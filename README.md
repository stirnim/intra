# Intra

Intra is an experimental tool that allows you to test DNS-over-TLS resolver
services that encrypt domain name lookups and prevent manipulation by your
network.

This app is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/intra">Jigsaw's
Intra</a> tool which supports DNS-over-HTTPS instead.

Features:
* Visualization of server performance and application query behavior
* Geocoding of query results to compare against expected regional results
